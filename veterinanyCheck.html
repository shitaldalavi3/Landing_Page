                Well this is very similar to what you would get at your doctors office when you show up for a physical exam. They start off with a weigh in and then check you from head to toe only in your pets case it would from nose to tail!

                During an exam we check your pet's eyes, ears, and teeth to make sure everything looks healthy. They're also listen your pets' heart for any irregular rhythms, feel their belly, and do an orthopedic exam to make sure joints are arthritis free.

        <h3>How Is Behavioural Training Different from Other Types of Training?</h3>
        <article><p>Dog behavioural training differs from other types of training in a few key ways. </p></article>
        <article><p>First, dog behaviourist training focuses on changing existing behaviours rather than teaching new ones. This means that the trainer must first identify the problem behaviour and then work to change it. </p></article>
        <article><p>Second, this often takes longer than other types of training, as behaviour change can be a slow process. </p></article>
        <article><p>Finally, dog behavioural training often requires more patience and consistency from both the trainer and the owner than other types of training.</p></article>
        <article><p>Here are some other types of dog training:</p></article>
        <article><p>Obedience Training – Teaches your dog to respond to commands such as sit, stay, down, and come. This training is usually the first step for pet owners who want to train their dogs.</p></article>
        <article><p>Agility Training – Teaches your dog to navigate an obstacle course within a set time frame.</p></article>
        <article><p>Service Training – Teaches your dog to perform specific tasks, such as pulling a wheelchair or assisting people with physical disabilities.</p></article>
        <article><p>Guard Training – Teaches your dog to act as a guard dog and protects you from intruders.</p></article>
        <article><p>Tracking Training – Teaches your dog how to track and find lost people or objects like drugs and bomb-sniffing. This type of training is used by search and rescue services, hunting, and the military.</p></article>
